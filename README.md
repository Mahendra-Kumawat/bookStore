Here is a rewritten version of the README.md file based on the current context:

# Bookstore API
================

## Overview
--------

This is a Node.js API for a bookstore application. It uses Express.js as the web framework and Mongoose for interacting with a MongoDB database.

## Error Handling
----------------

Error handling is crucial in any Node.js application. Without proper error handling, the application can crash and become unresponsive. In this application, we use the `http-error` package to handle errors in a production-ready way.

## Mongoose Connection
--------------------

When working with Mongoose and MongoDB, it's essential to handle connection events properly. We use the `mongoose.connections.on()` method to register event listeners for connection events, such as `connected` and `error`. This allows us to detect and handle any errors that may occur during the connection process.

## Getting Started
---------------

To get started with this application, make sure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/bookstore.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the application: `npm run dev`

## API Endpoints
--------------

The following API endpoints are available:

* `GET /`: Returns a welcome message
* `POST /books`: Creates a new book

## Configuration
--------------
The application uses a `config` object to store configuration settings. The `config` object is defined in `src/config/config.ts` and is used throughout the application.

## Database Connection
-------------------

The application uses Mongoose to connect to a MongoDB database. The database connection settings are stored in the `config` object.




## global error handler middleware 
--------------------------------
global error handler is the middleware in the express js and it is the best pratice to define the global error handler bottom of the routing so it's work properly.

and `app.use()` method is used for register the middleware in the express app.
